# phone-call-speaker-emotion-recognition
End to end model to take a phone call recording .wav file as input, perform diarization to separate 2 voices and analyze emotion

This is a code written in Python using the Keras library for building deep learning models. The code is for training a model for audio classification. It uses libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn for data processing and analysis. The model uses a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) architecture with an LSTM layer. The code also includes functions for data augmentation, which are applied to the audio data to generate additional training samples.
